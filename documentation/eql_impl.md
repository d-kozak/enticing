# EQL implementation 
This document describes how EQL is implemented. For the description of it's functionality, see [EQL specification](./eql_spec.md). 

The work eql is doing can be divided into three parts.
1. parsing & validating query
2. querying
3. postprocessing 

Each of them will now be described in more details.
